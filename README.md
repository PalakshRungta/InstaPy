The following code helps you learn more about yourself by analysing your Instagram data!

With this code, you could:
1. Obtain a list of people who you follow but don't follow you back.
2. Find your most liked pages.
3. Search for messages by text (even deleted messages).
4. Search for messages by user name (even deleted messages).

To be able to run this code successfully, you will need to follow the steps below:

1. Go to Settings under the Instagram app.
2. Go to Security and click on Download Data. This will prompt you to type your email ID. The data transfer process takes about 2-3 business days.
3. Download your data from the email you recieve.
4. Unzip the file and rename the part 1 folder named something along the lines <b>"userName_date_part_1"</b> to <b>"instagram_data_1"</b>
5. Make sure this notebook/file is in the same location as the folder.
6. Run the file and have fun!
